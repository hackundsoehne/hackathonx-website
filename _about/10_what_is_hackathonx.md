hackathon x is a cooperation between the student organisation Hack & Söhne and the Creative Collections project, which is dedicated to opening up the Badisches Landesmuseum to the participation of its users and developing new digital concepts. Since the museum visit should not only be educational, but also entertaining and fun, the focus of the hackathon is on gaming in museums.

The background to the hackathon is the revolutionary new concept of the Badisches Landesmuseum: museum visitors become active users of the museum. For this purpose, the objects are made accessible in a digital catalogue and the admission ticket is replaced by a user card linked to a personal user account.

The heart of the new concept is the “Expothek”, which resembles a research laboratory. Original objects can be directly displayed on presentation tables, and digital workplaces offer the opportunity to research the objects. Digital features and modern technologies such as 3D scanning and virtual reality also offer innovative ways to experience culture and history. The concept is being tested for the first time in the new permanent exhibition “Archaeology in Baden”.

Join us and become part of this special hackathon! Let’s develop playful approaches to the museum, the collections or the existing digital infrastructure. A special extra: particularly exciting ideas can also be further developed or even implemented after the hackathon.

Note: On November 13th, our juror Sabiha Ghellal offers a workshop on the development of games in museums. The workshop is of course not a prerequisite for participating in the hackathon, but everyone interested is welcome.
