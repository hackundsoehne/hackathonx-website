[Hack & Söhne](https://hackundsoehne.de/) is a German student-run nonprofit organization focused on coding and hacking. We try to bring a bit of Silicon Valley to the German computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by organizing hackathons, coding boot camps and other similar events.

Our team consists of students from a variety of backgrounds: computer science and electrical engineering, economics, business, and more.
