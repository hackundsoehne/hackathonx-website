LIDAR technology is used in a wide range of applications from autonomous driving to the design of 3D city models.</p> <p>Recently, LIDAR data in various resolutions has become freely available in NRW and Thuringia. A particular challenge is the extraction of geometrically correct objects from these data sets, such as roof shapes, vegetation, bridges, or power lines. This is relevant for applications such as energy planning, environmental monitoring, building and city modelling, urban planning or disaster management.</p> <h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3> <p>Get creative and get the most out of LIDAR data sets. Develop routines to identify objects, settlements or cities; create visualizations and models; link your objects with other freely available data and, last but not least, tell us HOW and for WHOM your development can be valuable (don’t hesitate to design a business case for us). Machine learning approaches are particularly suitable, but knowledge of geoinformation systems (GIS), architecture, design or urban planning or other potential user perspectives is also helpful.</p> <h4 id="data-sets">Data sets</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/dom/dom1l/index.html">Open LIDAR data from NRW</a> (depending on location between 2GB - 23GB)</li> <li><a href="https://www.geoportal-th.de/de-de/Downloadbereiche/Download-Offene-Geodaten-Th%C3%BCringen">Open LIDAR data from Thuringia</a></li> </ul> <h4 id="eifer-prize">EIFER Prize</h4> <p>The winning team members will <em>each</em> receive 1 iPad and will be invited to EIFER’s “Smart City Lab” as an occasion to exchange with scientific experts and explore further developments of their project.</p> <h4 id="fokusenergie-prize">Fokus.energie Prize</h4> <p>The winning team will get from <a href="https://www.fokusenergie.net/de/index.php">fokus.energie</a> a professional day training on business development within the program TEAM DEVELOPMENT powered by <a href="https://axel.energy/en/index.php">AXEL – The Energy-Accelerator</a>.</p> <h4 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h4> <p>We’ll be looking at your ideas from four different angles:</p> <ol> <li>technical innovation &amp; creativity</li> <li>execution &amp; polish</li> <li>business model &amp; value generation</li> <li>communication &amp; pitch</li> </ol> <p>For further insight on these criteria, technical support and any other question, we’ll be happily at your disposal at our booth.</p> <h4 id="further-information">Further information</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://grindgis.com/data/lidar-data-50-applications">LIDAR Data 50 Applications</a></li> <li><a href="http://desktop.arcgis.com/de/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/las-dataset/what-is-lidar-data-.htm">What is lidar data</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="accordion"> <a class="accordion-btn " href="#"> <span><b>The Entrepreneurial Spirit</b> <span>by PionierGarage</span></span> <span class="accordion-indicator"></span> </a> <div class="accordion-panel colored"><h3 id="topic">Topic</h3> <p>We are the PionierGarage and the first point of contact in Karlsruhe, when a new idea was born.</p> <p>Every successful founder started with an innovative idea and the entrepreneurial mindset.

This challenge is part of a future art-installation and certainly not an easy task.</p> <h4 id="background">Background</h4> <p>The specific usage of german language in the area of public institutions such as job centers or insurance companies is a widespread rhetoric. This rhetoric, in german scientifically known under the term „Verwaltungssprache” (language of officialdom), is commonly used for letters. Practically, it is the method and tool for institutions to organize and communicate issues and problems with their clients.</p> <p>The aim of the art project is a transformation of a dataset of documents into a trained artificial intelligence communicating in „Verwaltungssprache“. The generated text appears in an official letter, printed in random patterns to camouflage common office objects. Finally, the objects will be presented in an installation to become a visual room of melting shapes immersed in documents. Together with a large projection of various documents a voice reads the fictional letters with requirements to the recipients, who can move freely through the room. In the long run, an own, collected dataset of real documents will improve the the trained model.</p> <h3 id="your-task">Your Task</h3> <h4 id="requirement">Requirement</h4> <p>Our tasks main body of work is the automatic text generation of bureaucratic letters in the “Verwaltungssprache”. The generated output should be used as random patterns in the art installation, printed by hydrography onto common office objects. Every team submitting in our category has to provide some solution to this problem. We try our best to assist you in this challenge and provide possible training-data, pre-trained models and a small kickoff-presentation.</p> <h4 id="optional">Optional</h4> <p>Furthermore, we want to challenge you and your team to come up with possible extensions of the system. From an interesting text-to-speech implementation to an interface for scanning and submitting personal documents, it’s up to you to convince us with the right idea!</p> <p>We have compiled some possible extensions:</p> <ul> <li>In order to obtain print-ready files, a post-processing program could help to transform the output of the machine learning system into random patterns.</li> <li>The project is long-term which gives us the possibility to build up an own dataset. Therefore an easy to use web interface to submit real documents may be interesting if you like to think about interfaces. Furthermore, this web-interface could be optimized for smartphones, allowing the participants of the installation to indirectly influence the machine learning model.</li> <li>Another field of interest could be the transformation from text into to speech. You can play with the phonological appearance of the output or just combine already existing applications to archive this optional task.</li> </ul> <h3 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h3> <p>Don’t sweat it, the projects don’t need to be perfect. Your results get judged according to:</p> <h4 id="required-task">Required Task</h4> <ul> <li>text should be easily recognizable as „Verwaltungssprache“. We don’t care that much about generalizability or a perfect reproduction of bureaucratic letters. Visible Artifacts of the machine-learning model don’t need to be avoided completely.</li> </ul> <h4 id="optional-task">Optional Task</h4> <ul> <li>crossover usability of the main and optional tasks.</li> <li>creativity</li> <li>technical implementation</li> </ul> <h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3> <p>It doesn’t look like we could provide any prize money. But the winner’s work will be part of the artwork and will be honored by name. If the artwork is placed with the work of your group at a festival, for example, you have the opportunity to participate. We hope to be able to place the installation at a more influential festival and thus generate relevant reach.</p> </div> </div> <!-- <div class="content-footer"> <p><strong>But That's Not All!</strong></p> <p><strong>Check Back <mark class="accent-tc">Soon</mark> For More Categories.</strong></p> </div> --> <script> var accs = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion-btn"); for (var i = 0; i < accs.length; i++) { accs[i].addEventListener("click", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); this.classList.toggle("active"); }); } </script> </div> </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="footer-logos"> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hackundsoehne.de/"> <img src="/assets/images/hs_logo_white.png" alt="Hack und Soehne Logo"> </a> </div> <nav class="footer-links"> <a class="footer-link" href="https://hackundsoehne.de/team"> Team </a> <a class="footer-link" href="https://hackundsoehne.de/contact"> Contact </a> <a class="footer-link" href="/coc-public.pdf"> Code of Conduct </a> <a class="footer-link" href="/legal.html"> Legal </a> <a class="footer-link" href="/privacy.html"> Privacy </a> </nav> </div> </footer> <style> .colored a, .colored mark, .accent-tc { color: #ff00b6 !important; } .accent-bg { background-color: #ff00b6 !important; } .accent-bc { border-color: #ff00b6 !important; } body { background-image: url('/assets/images/shapes/Form2_pink_transparent.svg'); background-position: 70vw -40vh; } </style> <script type="text/javascript"> Smooch.init({ appId: '5db616dc3c1b9300101aef38', customText: { headerText: 'How can we help?', inputPlaceholder: 'Type a message, anonymously...', sendButtonText: 'Send' } }).then( function() { }, function(err) { console.log('error'); } ); </script> </body> </html>
